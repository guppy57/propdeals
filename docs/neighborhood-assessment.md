## Letter Grade Justification
Grade C is assigned due to elevated crime (roughly 5,042 incidents per 100k vs 3,829 citywide, about 31.7% higher), high vacancy at 11.4%, and very low local incomes ($34,053 median). While pricing is low ($148,829 median) and rent-to-price is serviceable at about 0.5%, the distressed housing stock and socioeconomic profile add risk. Citywide market stability and some local investment projects prevent a lower grade.

## Demand Drivers
Martin Luther King Jr. Park is an urban core neighborhood northeast of downtown Des Moines, bounded by I‑235 and major corridors, giving residents relatively convenient access to downtown jobs and services. Rents and cost of living are low (cost-of-living index 79; median rent about $644 in one source), attracting cost-sensitive workforce households. Metro-wide renter demand is described as strong, with a shrinking construction pipeline supporting occupancy.

## Market Trend
Neighborhood-specific appreciation data is unavailable, but citywide median sales prices rose about 4% year-over-year as of August 2025, with inventory up 14% and the market still in seller’s territory. Analysts note the broader Des Moines housing market is shifting from a hot seller’s market toward balance, with prices generally stable to modestly rising. Multifamily construction starts are down 66% year-over-year, with 2025 expected to bring stabilization in occupancy and healthier rent growth metro-wide.

## Risk Factors
- Crime rate about 5,042 per 100k vs 3,829 citywide (≈31.7% higher), with violent crime particularly elevated, increasing security, insurance, and management risk.  
- Very low incomes (median $34,053; income lower than 88% of U.S. neighborhoods) and higher childhood poverty (22% of children below the federal poverty line) imply a financially fragile tenant base.  
- High vacancy (11.4%) with many units vacant year-round, signaling weak demand or structural oversupply and potential for longer lease-up times.  
- Housing stock historically classified as “distressed,” with 18% of homes rated below normal/poor/very poor and foreclosures previously higher than the city average (8.6% vs 5.5%), suggesting ongoing CapEx and resale-risk concerns.

## Catalysts
- A 12‑unit affordable housing project at 1603 Walker St (≈$2 million) directly in MLK Park will add new, higher-quality workforce housing to the neighborhood.  
- The Southeast Connector/Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway extension, backed by a $34 million federal grant, will complete a key transportation link between the US 65/Highway 5 bypass and downtown, improving regional access.  
- The metro multifamily pipeline is shrinking sharply (construction starts down 66%), which should ease competitive pressure and help stabilize rents and occupancy.  
- Citywide, home prices are still edging upward and market conditions are broadly stable, supporting long-run liquidity even in lower-priced submarkets.

## Tenant Profile
Data indicates a predominantly low-income, working-class neighborhood, with incomes among the lowest in the country and 40.8% of workers in manufacturing-related roles. Renters are likely value-oriented households and families seeking affordable housing near downtown and major corridors, including those targeted by affordable/workforce housing initiatives.
